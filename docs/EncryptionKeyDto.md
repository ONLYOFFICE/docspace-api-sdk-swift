# EncryptionKeyDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **UUID** | Names the pair inside its owner's key set. Pass it back to rotate the pair or to delete it; the all-zero value  belongs to a client that stores its keys without sending an identifier. | [optional] 
**userId** | **UUID** | The member the pair belongs to. In the key set of a room or of a file this is how the caller tells its own  entries, the ones carrying a private half, from those of the other members. | [optional] 
**date** | **Date** | When this key material was written. Rotating the pair refreshes it, so it dates the material that is being  reported rather than the first appearance of the identifier. | [optional] 
**publicKey** | **String** | The public half of the pair, the half a client encrypts file keys with. A pair whose public half is missing  is treated as no access and left out of a room's or a file's key set. | [optional] 
**privateKeyEnc** | **String** | The private half, encrypted with its owner's password. It is filled in only when the pair belongs to the  calling user; on another member's entry it comes back empty, because the private half is not handed out. | [optional] 
**cryptoEngineId** | **String** | The crypto engine this material was issued for, as a braced GUID. The engine is portal-wide, so the same value  comes back for every key of every member. | [optional]
