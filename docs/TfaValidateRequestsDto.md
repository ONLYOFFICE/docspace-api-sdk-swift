# TfaValidateRequestsDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**code** | **String** | The code to check - either one from the authenticator application or one of the account's unused backup  codes, which is spent by the check. A wrong code is refused with 400 and counts against the portal login  attempt limit. | 
**session** | **Bool** | Whether the sign-in that follows is tied to the browser session. When it is, the session ends with the  browser rather than lasting for the portal session lifetime. | [optional]
