# DnsSettingsRequestsDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**dnsName** | **String** | The domain the portal is to be reachable under, as a bare hostname without a scheme. It must not collide with  the reserved base domain of the installation, and a name that fails validation is refused without disturbing  the mapping in force. It is read only while `enable` is true. | [optional] 
**enable** | **Bool** | Whether the custom domain is put in force. Setting it false clears the mapping and ignores `dnsName`; setting  it true also stops the previous domain from answering and rewrites any Content Security Policy entry that  named it. | [optional]
