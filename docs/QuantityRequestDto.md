# QuantityRequestDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**quantity** | **[String: Int]** | The plan and the number of units it is to cover, as a single pair. While the portal is on a priced plan the  key has to be the `name` of that same plan, which `GET api/2.0/portal/payment/quota` reports, because the  subscription is resized rather than swapped; the value is the total the subscription is to have afterwards,  not the difference. Exactly one pair is accepted, and a value that is already in effect is refused with 400. |
