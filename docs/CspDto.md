## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**domains** | **[String]** | The external hosts an administrator has allowed, each in the form it was saved in - a bare host, a host  with a scheme, or a wildcard such as `*.example.com`. An empty list means nobody has added one, not that  the portal serves no policy. | 
**header** | **String** | The complete policy value the portal sends to browsers, assembled from `domains` together with the  portal's own sources and the integrations it has switched on. It is therefore wider than `domains` alone,  and is filled in even while that list is empty. |
