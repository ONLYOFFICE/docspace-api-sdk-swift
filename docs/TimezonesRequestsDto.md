# TimezonesRequestsDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** | The IANA identifier of the time zone. This is the value the portal time zone is set to, so pass it on  unchanged to `PUT api/2.0/settings/timeandlanguage`. | 
**displayName** | **String** | The label to show for the zone, carrying its UTC offset as it stood when the list was built. The offset is a  snapshot rather than a rule, so a zone observing daylight saving reads differently at other times of the  year; sort and match on `id` instead. |
