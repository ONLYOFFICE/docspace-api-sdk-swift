## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**user** | **String** | Who or what the line stands for, as a display string: the display name of a member, the name of a group, or  the title given to a shared link when `isLink` is true. It is empty when the subject has no name to show - a  shared link that was never given a title, for instance. | [optional] 
**permissions** | **String** | The access level of that subject as a localized label, not a code: inside a room it usually names the role the  subject holds there (Viewer, Editor, Room Manager), while outside a room it names the access itself  (Read Only, Full Access). The wording comes from the portal resources and is translated for the current  language, so show it to a person rather than compare it in code. | [optional] 
**isLink** | **Bool** | Whether the line stands for a shared link instead of a member or a group. Clients use it to draw a link badge  where they would otherwise draw an avatar. | [optional]
