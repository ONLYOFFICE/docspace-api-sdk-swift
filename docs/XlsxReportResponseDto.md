# XlsxReportResponseDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**form** | [**FileDto**](FileDto.md) | The original form the answers are collected from. It is not the produced spreadsheet - that one arrives with  the task, once the task reports completion. | [optional] 
**task** | [**DocumentBuilderTaskDto**](DocumentBuilderTaskDto.md) | The queued generation. Poll it with `GET api/2.0/files/file/{fileId}/xlsx` until it reports completion, and  take the produced file from it then. | [optional] 
**isNewFile** | **Bool** | True when this run creates the report file, false when an existing report is rewritten in place, which means  it keeps its id and the links already shared for it. | [optional]
