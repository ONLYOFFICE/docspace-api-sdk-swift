# WebItemSecurityRequestsDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** | The module the rule applies to, given as a GUID. A value that is not a GUID fails the request as invalid. | 
**enabled** | **Bool** | Whether the module may be opened. It decides the outcome only while `subjects` names somebody: an empty  `subjects` array is stored as access for everyone whatever this flag says. | [optional] 
**subjects** | **[UUID]** | The users and groups the rule is stored for, given by their IDs. This is the whole allow-list that is to hold  afterwards and not a list of additions - what was stored before is dropped. Leaving it out applies `enabled`  to everyone and skips the audit trail entry, while sending it empty stores access for everyone. | [optional]
