# WebhooksConfigDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **Int** | The identifier of the subscription, which is what `PUT api/2.0/settings/webhook`,  `DELETE api/2.0/settings/webhook/{id}` and the `configId` filter of the delivery log address it by. | 
**name** | **String** | The label the subscription was given, free text with no meaning to the portal. | [optional] 
**uri** | **String** | The address every delivery is posted to. The signing secret that lets the receiver verify a delivery is  never part of this answer, so it has to be kept from the moment the subscription was created. | [optional] 
**enabled** | **Bool** | Whether the subscription is delivering. While it is `false` events are dropped rather than queued, so  nothing arrives late after it is switched back on. | [optional] 
**ssl** | **Bool** | Whether the certificate of `uri` is verified before a delivery. While it is `false` a self-signed  certificate is accepted as well. | [optional] 
**triggers** | [**WebhookTrigger**](WebhookTrigger.md) | The events the subscription covers, as the bits of `GET api/2.0/settings/webhook/triggers` added  together. `0` is the catch-all and means every event, not none. | [optional] 
**targetId** | **String** | The single room or file the subscription is narrowed to, empty for a subscription that covers the whole  portal. It is kept as an opaque value, so both a numeric and a third-party identifier can appear. | [optional] 
**createdBy** | [**EmployeeDto**](EmployeeDto.md) | The member who created the subscription, which is also who a non-administrator is limited to seeing. It is  empty for a subscription created by a portal background job. | [optional] 
**createdOn** | **Date** | When the subscription was created, in the portal time zone. | [optional] 
**modifiedBy** | [**EmployeeDto**](EmployeeDto.md) | The member who last changed the subscription, empty while nobody has changed it since it was created. | [optional] 
**modifiedOn** | **Date** | When it was last changed, in the portal time zone, and empty under the same condition as `modifiedBy`. | [optional] 
**lastFailureOn** | **Date** | When a delivery last failed, in the portal time zone. It is empty for a subscription that has never  failed, and it is not cleared by a later success - compare it with `lastSuccessOn` to see which came last. | [optional] 
**lastFailureContent** | **String** | What the target answered on that failure, truncated, for diagnosing without opening the delivery log. It  is empty when the failure produced no body at all, a timeout for instance. | [optional] 
**lastSuccessOn** | **Date** | When a delivery last succeeded, in the portal time zone, empty for a subscription that has never  delivered. Both this and `lastFailureOn` being empty means nothing has been attempted yet. | [optional]
