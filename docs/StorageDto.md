# StorageDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** | The provider's key, which is what `PUT api/2.0/settings/storage` and its CDN and backup counterparts take  as the storage to switch to. The built-in local storage has no entry of its own: a listing in which  nothing is `current` means the data sits locally. | 
**title** | **String** | The provider name in the portal language, falling back to `id` when this build ships no wording for it. | 
**properties** | [AuthKey] | The settings the provider expects, each with its key, its localised label and the value the server  currently holds. For the entry marked `current` the values come from the portal's saved storage settings  and for the others from the installation configuration, so a setting nobody has configured comes back with  an empty value rather than being left out. | [optional] 
**current** | **Bool** | Whether the portal is using this provider right now. At most one entry of a listing has it set. | 
**isSet** | **Bool** | Whether the provider's keys are already filled in on the server, so it could be switched to without  sending credentials. It says nothing about whether the credentials still work. |
