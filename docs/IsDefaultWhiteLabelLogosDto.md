# IsDefaultWhiteLabelLogosDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **String** | The stable name of the slot, matching the `name` of the same slot in  `GET api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logos` - `LightSmall`, `LoginPage`, `Favicon`, `DocsEditor` and the rest,  plus `Notification`, which that list leaves out. The wordmark check reports the fixed name `logotext`  instead of a slot. | 
**_default** | **Bool** | Whether the slot has never been written for this portal, in which case the built-in image is what gets  rendered. It turns `false` once an image has been stored, for either the light or the dark theme, and back  to `true` after the matching restore operation. For `logotext` it stays `true` when the built-in wordmark  itself is saved, because saving that value counts as clearing the setting. |
