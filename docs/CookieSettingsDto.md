**lifeTime** | **Int** | How long, in minutes, a session issued from now on remains valid. It is `1440` on a portal that has never  stored a limit, and that stored number is reported whether or not `enabled` puts it to use. | 
**enabled** | **Bool** | Whether the stored lifetime is applied at all. While it is `false` the number above is ignored and an  issued session is honoured for a year. |
