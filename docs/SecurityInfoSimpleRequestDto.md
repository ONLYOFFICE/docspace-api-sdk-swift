# SecurityInfoSimpleRequestDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**share** | [FileShareParams] | One record per account or group whose rights are being set, each naming the subject and the level it gets; a  level of `None` takes the access away. An empty collection makes the call change nothing. | [optional] 
**notify** | **Bool** | Set to true to have every account named in `share` emailed about the access it just received; false changes  the rights without telling anyone. | [optional] 
**sharingMessage** | **String** | The text put into that email, ignored while `notify` is false. Markup is stripped before sending, so only the  plain text of the value survives. | [optional]
