## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**productId** | **UUID** | The module the role applies to, given by its GUID. The all-zero GUID stands for the portal itself and grants  or revokes the DocSpace administrator role, which covers every module at once; a GUID that names no module  group is stored without effect rather than refused. | 
**userId** | **UUID** | The portal member the role is given to or taken from, by user ID. The member has to exist already - nobody is  created here - and promoting a guest or a plain member turns them into a paid one. | 
**administrator** | **Bool** | Which way the role goes: `true` adds the member to the module administrator group, `false` removes them from  it. Taking away the portal-wide role also drops the member from every product group. | [optional]
