# UpdateFile

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**title** | **String** | The new title of the file, without an extension - the stored extension is kept whatever the title says, so a  rename cannot change the format. Left empty, the file keeps its name. | [optional] 
**lastVersion** | **Int** | The version to restore on top of the history, as reported by `GET api/2.0/files/file/{fileId}/history`; 0 or  less leaves the versions untouched. | [optional]
