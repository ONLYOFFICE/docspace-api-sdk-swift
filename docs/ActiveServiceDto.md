# ActiveServiceDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**service** | **String** | The stable key of the service, which is what `POST api/2.0/portal/payment/servicestate` takes to switch  it off again. | [optional] 
**serviceUnit** | **String** | What `limit` and `used` count, in the portal language - gigabytes, editor seats, credits. | [optional] 
**subscription** | **Bool** | Whether the service is billed as a standing subscription rather than per unit consumed. Only a  subscription can carry `limit` and `used`. | [optional] 
**title** | **String** | The service name in the portal language, for printing rather than matching. | [optional] 
**limit** | **Int** | How much of the service the portal is entitled to. It is empty for a service whose consumption is not  counted this way, which is not the same as a service without a limit. | [optional] 
**used** | **Int** | How much of that allowance is in use - the editors currently active for the cloud editors, the units  already consumed for disk storage. Empty under the same conditions as `limit`. | [optional]
