# UpdateApiKeyRequest

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **String** | The new label of the key, up to 30 characters. Omit it to keep the current name. | [optional] 
**permissions** | **[String]** | The scopes that replace the current ones. Every value has to come from `GET api/2.0/keys/permissions`, an  unknown value or an empty array is rejected, and omitting the field keeps the current scopes. | [optional] 
**isActive** | **Bool** | Whether the key may authenticate requests. Set it to false to stop the key without deleting it and to true to  let it work again; omit it to keep the current state. | [optional]
