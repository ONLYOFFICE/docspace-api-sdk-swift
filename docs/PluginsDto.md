Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**enabled** | **Bool** | Whether web plugins run on this portal at all. While it is `false` the operations under  `api/2.0/settings/webplugins` are of no use, whatever the other two flags say. All three are `false`  unless the installation switched plugins on in its configuration. | [optional] 
**upload** | **Bool** | Whether an administrator may add a plugin of their own through  `POST api/2.0/settings/webplugins`. While it is `false` only the plugins that ship with the installation  are available. | [optional] 
**delete** | **Bool** | Whether an added plugin may be removed again through `DELETE api/2.0/settings/webplugins/{name}`. The  plugins that ship with the installation cannot be removed regardless of this flag. | [optional]
