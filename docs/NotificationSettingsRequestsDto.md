# NotificationSettingsRequestsDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | [**NotificationType**](NotificationType.md) | The kind of notification being switched. A value outside the defined set is echoed back while nothing is  stored, so confirm the result with `GET api/2.0/settings/notification/{type}` rather than trusting the  answer. | 
**isEnabled** | **Bool** | Whether that kind reaches the calling account. It applies to the caller own account alone and to every room  at once; a single room is silenced with `POST api/2.0/settings/notification/rooms` instead. | [optional]
