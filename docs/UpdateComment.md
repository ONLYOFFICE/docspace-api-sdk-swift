# UpdateComment

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**version** | **Int** | The version the comment belongs to, as reported by `GET api/2.0/files/file/{fileId}/edit/history`. A version  that does not exist is rejected as an invalid request. | 
**comment** | **String** | The note that explains what changed in that version, as the version history shows it. An empty text clears the  note, and a longer one is cut rather than refused, so read the stored text from the answer. | [optional]
