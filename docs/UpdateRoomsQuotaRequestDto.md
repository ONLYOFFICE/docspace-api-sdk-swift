# UpdateRoomsQuotaRequestDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**roomIds** | [DuplicateRequestDtoAllOfFileIds] | The rooms to change, named by the identifiers that `GET api/2.0/files/rooms` reports. Only whole numbers are  processed, so identifiers of rooms kept in a connected third-party account are skipped without an error. | [optional] 
**quota** | **Int64** | The storage each of the listed rooms may take, in bytes. It has to stay inside the portal own limit, and the  per-room quota feature has to be on, otherwise nothing is changed. | [optional]
