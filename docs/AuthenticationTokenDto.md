# AuthenticationTokenDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**token** | **String** | The token to put in the `Authorization` header of later calls. It is empty whenever a second factor is  still outstanding, which is what `sms` or `tfa` then says; the same token is also set as a portal cookie by  the call that issued it, so a browser client does not have to carry it itself. | [optional] 
**expires** | **Date** | When the token stops being accepted. It stays at its zero value when `session=true` tied the token to the  browser session instead of to a fixed moment. On the two operations that only send an SMS it carries a  different meaning: there is no token, and this is the moment the code that was just sent expires. | [optional] 
**sms** | **Bool** | Whether an SMS code is the second factor in play. Next to an empty `token` it means the code has to be sent  to `POST api/2.0/authentication/{code}` before a token is issued; next to a filled `token` it means the  code just accepted was an SMS one. | [optional] 
**phoneNoise** | **String** | The stored phone number with its middle digits masked, filled in only while `sms` is set and a number is  already activated for the user. It is there to be shown to the person signing in, not to be sent back. | [optional] 
**tfa** | **Bool** | Whether an authenticator app is the second factor in play, with the same two readings as `sms`. | [optional] 
**tfaKey** | **String** | The secret to enrol in an authenticator app, in the manual-entry form. It is filled in only while `tfa` is  set and the app has not been connected yet, which is the one moment the secret is handed out; once the app  is connected it stays empty. `GET api/2.0/settings/tfaapp/setup` returns the same secret with a QR code. | [optional] 
**confirmUrl** | **String** | The confirmation link the client has to open to get past the second factor. It points at phone activation  while no number is activated, at authenticator-app activation while the app is not connected, and at the  plain code prompt once either is in place. It is empty in an answer that already carries a token. | [optional]
