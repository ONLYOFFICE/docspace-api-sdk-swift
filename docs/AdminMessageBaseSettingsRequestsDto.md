## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**email** | **String** | The address the join link is sent to. It has to be a well-formed ASCII address rather than an  internationalized one, must not already belong to a member of the portal, and, where the portal trusts named  domains only, has to end with one of them; any of these faults is refused with 400. | 
**culture** | **String** | The language the letter is written in, as a culture name such as `en-US`. A culture the installation does not  have falls back to the portal language rather than failing the call. | [optional]
