# TariffDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**openSource** | **Bool** | Whether the installation runs the open-source build, which has no paid plan at all. This flag and the two  below describe the build rather than the subscription, and all three are left empty for a caller without  the portal-settings right. | [optional] 
**enterprise** | **Bool** | Whether the installation runs on an Enterprise licence file, which is what makes the licence operations  under `api/2.0/settings/license` usable. | [optional] 
**developer** | **Bool** | Whether the installation runs on a Developer licence, an Enterprise licence meant for embedding rather  than for production use. | [optional] 
**id** | **Int** | The identifier of the subscription record itself, for quoting when a charge has to be traced. It is filled  in for a caller with the portal-settings right only, and nothing accepts it as an argument. | [optional] 
**state** | [**TariffState**](TariffState.md) | How the subscription stands: on trial, paid, inside the grace period that follows the due date, or unpaid.  It is the one field every caller gets, whatever their role, so a client can warn about payment without  needing administrator rights. | [optional] 
**dueDate** | [**ApiDateTime**](ApiDateTime.md) | When the current period ends, in the portal time zone. It is filled in for a room or DocSpace  administrator only, and set to the largest value a date can hold for a subscription that never ends. | [optional] 
**delayDueDate** | [**ApiDateTime**](ApiDateTime.md) | When the grace period after `dueDate` runs out and the portal is cut off, in the portal time zone. Filled  in under the same conditions as `dueDate`, and equal to it when the plan grants no grace period. | [optional] 
**licenseDate** | [**ApiDateTime**](ApiDateTime.md) | When the licence file behind the subscription was issued, in the portal time zone. It is meaningful on a  server installation and filled in for a caller with the portal-settings right only. | [optional] 
**customerId** | **String** | The account in the billing system the subscription is charged to, empty for a portal that has never been  billed. Filled in for a caller with the portal-settings right only. | [optional] 
**quotas** | [TariffQuotaDto] | The quotas the subscription is made of - the plan itself and its add-ons - with the overdue ones listed  alongside the current ones, so an entry here is not proof that it is still being paid for; read each  entry's own `state` for that. Filled in for a caller with the portal-settings right only. | [optional]
