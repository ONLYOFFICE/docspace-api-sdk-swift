**email** | **String** | The address to send the password recovery link to. It is required and validated even by  `POST api/2.0/people/guests/share/approve`, which then ignores its value and takes the account from the  confirmation token instead. | 
**recaptchaType** | [**RecaptchaType**](RecaptchaType.md) | Which CAPTCHA the `recaptchaResponse` comes from: `Default` for the web reCAPTCHA, `AndroidV2` or `iOSV2` for  the mobile ones, and `hCaptcha` when the portal is configured with hCaptcha. It matters only for an  unauthenticated request on a portal that has a CAPTCHA. | [optional] 
**recaptchaResponse** | **String** | The user's response to the CAPTCHA challenge. | [optional]
