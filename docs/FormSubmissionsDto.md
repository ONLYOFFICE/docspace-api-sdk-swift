# FormSubmissionsDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**metadata** | [FormMetadata] | Describes the fields of the form version that is being filled - the key each value is stored under, the type  and format of the field and, where the field offers a fixed set of answers, those answers - in the order the  fields are laid out, which is the order to build a results table in. It comes back empty when the portal holds  no indexed description of that version. | [optional] 
**submissions** | [FormResultsDto] | One entry per completed copy, ordered by the copy number that `formsData` carries. An empty list means nothing  has been completed for the version that is currently being filled; the copies of earlier versions of the form  are not reported here. | [optional]
