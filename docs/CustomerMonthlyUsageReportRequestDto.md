# CustomerMonthlyUsageReportRequestDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**startDate** | **Date** | The beginning of the reported period, inclusive. The months are cut in the portal time zone rather than in  UTC, so spending at the turn of a month falls where the portal sees it; defaults to the portal creation date. | [optional] 
**endDate** | **Date** | The end of the reported period, inclusive. Cut in the portal time zone in the same way as `startDate`, and  defaults to the moment the call is made. | [optional]
