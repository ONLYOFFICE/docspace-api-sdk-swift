## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**returnSingleOperation** | **Bool** | Which operations the answer carries: `true` returns the operation this call started and nothing else, `false`  returns every operation of the same kind that the caller has running or unread. When nothing was queued, which  happens for an empty selection, `true` falls back to the full list. | [optional] 
**folderIds** | [DuplicateRequestDtoAllOfFolderIds] | The folders to duplicate, by id; the copy of each one is created in the folder that already holds it. A number  addresses a folder stored in the portal itself, a string addresses a folder on a connected third-party  account, and both kinds may be sent in one list. | [optional] 
**fileIds** | [DuplicateRequestDtoAllOfFileIds] | The files to duplicate, by id; the copy of each one is created in the folder that already holds it. A number  addresses a file stored in the portal itself, a string addresses a file on a connected third-party account,  and both kinds may be sent in one list. | [optional]
