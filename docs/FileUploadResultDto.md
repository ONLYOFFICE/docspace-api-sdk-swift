# FileUploadResultDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**success** | **Bool** | Whether the upload succeeded. This is the field to check: the operation answers 200 even when it fails, and  reports the reason in `message` instead of in the status code. | [optional] 
**data** | **JSONValue** |  | [optional] 
**message** | **String** | The reason the upload failed, ready to be shown to a person. It is empty for a successful upload, and it is  the only place where a failure is described, because the status code stays 200. | [optional]
