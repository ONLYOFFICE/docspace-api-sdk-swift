# NotificationChannelDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **String** | The internal name of the channel as the notification service knows it - `email.sender` for letters,  `telegram.sender` for Telegram messages. It is a key to match on, not a label to print. | 
**isEnabled** | **Bool** | Whether the channel can deliver for this portal. Letters are enabled whenever the channel is listed at  all, while Telegram is enabled only while the portal has a bot name and token stored. It says nothing  about the caller, who also has to connect their own Telegram account through  `GET api/2.0/settings/telegram/link`. |
