# RoomFromTemplateStatusDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**roomId** | **Int** | The room the job is creating. It is meaningful once the room exists, which is guaranteed only after  `isCompleted` turns true and `error` stays empty; until then it carries no usable id. | 
**progress** | **Double** | How far the job has got. The value climbs while the contents of the template are being copied into the new  room and reaches its maximum at the very end. | 
**error** | **String** | Why the job stopped. It is empty while the job runs and after a successful one, and a filled value means that  no room was created, so the request has to be repeated rather than waited out. | 
**isCompleted** | **Bool** | Whether the job has ended. It is set both after a successful creation and after a failure, so it is the flag  to poll for, while `error` is what separates the two outcomes. |
