# SaveFormRoleMappingDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**formId** | **Int** | The PDF form the roles belong to. This is the value the operation reads, rather than the identifier in its  route, and the two are to be sent the same. | 
**roles** | [FormRole] | The roles with the account taking each of them and the sequence number that decides the turn: the same number  means the roles may be filled in parallel, different ones make a queue. The whole set is replaced on every  call, and an empty set resets the filling. |
