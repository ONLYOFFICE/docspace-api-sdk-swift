# WhiteLabelRequestsDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**logoText** | **String** | The wordmark printed next to or instead of a logo image, on the login page, in the editors and in  notification letters. An empty or blank value, and the built-in `ONLYOFFICE` itself, clear the setting rather  than store it. The text is not rendered into the logo images, which carry their own wordmark. | [optional] 
**logo** | [ItemKeyValuePairStringLogoRequestsDto] | The logo images to store, each entry naming a logo slot in its `key` - the numeric `type` published by  `GET api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logos` - and carrying the two theme images in its value. A slot left out of  the list keeps the image it has, so this is a partial update rather than a replacement of the whole branding.  Saving the login-page slot also rebuilds the notification logo from it. | [optional]
