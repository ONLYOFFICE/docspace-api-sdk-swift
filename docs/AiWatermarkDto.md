# AiWatermarkDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**additions** | [**AiWatermarkAdditions**](AiWatermarkAdditions.md) | Which details of the reader and of the room are stamped alongside the text. The values combine, so a number  that is not a member on its own is the sum of several of them, and 0 means that only the text is stamped. | 
**text** | **String** | The fixed line drawn over the document, printed before the details selected alongside it. Empty when the room  stamps an image instead. | [optional] 
**rotate** | **Int** | How far the stamp is turned, in degrees, with negative values turning it anticlockwise and 0 drawing it  horizontally. | 
**imageScale** | **Int** | How large the image is drawn, as a percentage of its own size. It is 0 for a text watermark, where nothing is  scaled. | 
**imageUrl** | **String** | The address the stamped picture is served from, inside the storage of the room. Empty for a text watermark. | [optional] 
**imageHeight** | **Double** | The height the picture is drawn with, in pixels, kept together with the width so that the proportions survive.  It is 0 for a text watermark. | 
**imageWidth** | **Double** | The width the picture is drawn with, in pixels, kept together with the height so that the proportions survive.  It is 0 for a text watermark. |
