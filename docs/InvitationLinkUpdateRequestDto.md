# InvitationLinkUpdateRequestDto

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **UUID** | The link to change, by the `id` that creating or reading it returned. The role behind that id cannot be  changed here. | 
**expiration** | **Date** | The new deadline, read in the portal time zone. The body is applied as a whole, so leaving it out clears the  deadline rather than keeping the current one; a moment in the past is refused. | [optional] 
**maxUseCount** | **Int** | The new total number of accounts that may join through the link. It may not be lower than the uses already  spent, which the link reports as `currentUseCount`, and leaving it out removes the limit rather than keeping  the current one. | [optional]
